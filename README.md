>[Robot Face](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/zJ1ElQyTE2E5sFEpg08aP467pZ1ys9RiCfcrRteUwNc)
>In this project I used shapes, variables, and randomness to express my creativity and created a Random Robot Face.

>[Caption Scene](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/78bCfNmtV3Xn1SEsFOmxM3MTQtERBqr112ewyMl4bS0)
>In this project we created an underwater scene with a fish and shark having a conversation. Underwater scene with a shark and fish. Multiple fish in the background. The fish is telling the shark not to eat him. They are all underwater with a background that shows the depth of the ocean. 

>[Interactive Card](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/4WW6O44y5Qiyx7kMGwy03t9_aExBsf4p4HKrDLRqkkM)
>In this project we created a poster for people to come to a guitarists concert. We used multiple sprites and conditionals to make the sprites move when user clicks correct imput. This is an interactive card with moving music notes and changing lights. 

>[Side Scroller](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/zb1r0DtLI9bDEJDuIqAxIdykgqULtDKbx5b82groRSM)
>In this project we created a game with three different sprites. We had a target, player, and obstacle. To make the player jump you have to press the space key. The player sprite wants to hit the target in order to increase the score. If they player hits the obstacle, then their health will go down.

>[Flyer Game](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/fPu31y7VefDB4BkUwQGBTA4gWln3V1gSmZOPdtFBNZs)
>In the project we created a game where you have to find the target while tryig not to hit the obstacle. The target moves everything you hit it. The goal is to beat your high score each time without losing health. Everytime you hit an obstacle your health will go down until you run out of health. 

>[Mini-Platform Jumper](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/bBUf53k9ndp_GzDk9pzMtNrZniyePmVTtOcOiGaOt_s).
>In this project we made a game where there is an owl sprite trying to get the books that are falling from the sky. There will be platforms that the owl can land on. The score will then go up when the owl hits the books. If the owl collides with a plane sprite or if the owl falls of the bottom of the screen then the game will be over.

>[Project-Design a game](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/bjCOvLgBY_DnjxZZbhwN--MGs9CuGGIWQdMP6xpbzNA).
>In this project I made a game where a dog is  to get an a soccerball and tennis ball while also avoiding the girl. The arrow keys to control the dog, while the girl is just going to move on and off the screen on a loop. I used functions to keep the game moving smooothly. The variable score goes up everytime the dog hits the soccer or tennis ball. The variable for lives go down everytime the dog collides with the girl. The game automatically ends if the dog falls of the bottom of the screen.

>[Piano Player](https://gallery.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryid=2b102cc5-5a9a-4a5f-87c0-87139a1d775a).
